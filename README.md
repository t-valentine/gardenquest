Game made in the Godot engine for [My First Game Jam: Summer 2022](https://myfirstgamejam.tumblr.com/) This game was completed between July 2 and July 16. This was the first time I have ever dabbled in game development, and took the opportunity to learn the Godot Engine. The game itself has a bug I was never able to resolve, but it's still techincally playable all the way through.
